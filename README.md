# CLAW-A-DOG

This game was created by a true animal lover an no furry friends were hurt in the making!

The game starts as a cat with 9 lives and the goal is to claw (click on) as many dogs as possible to earn points. 
Dog faces will randomly appear in different areas of the screen, earn points by trying to claw the dogs EXCEPT THE ONE DISPLAYED IN THE MAIN MENU! 
When the cat claws the wrong dog, it gets sprayed and loses a life. Once all 9 lives are used up or time runs out, it's game over.

Thank you for trying it out! Any suggestions are welcome.
